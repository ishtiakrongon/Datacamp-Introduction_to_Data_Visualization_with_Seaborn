# Datacamp-Introduction_to_Data_Visualization_with_Seaborn
 Seaborn is a powerful Python library that makes it easy to create informative and attractive visualizations. This course provides an introduction to Seaborn and teaches how to visualize data using plots such as scatter plots, box plots, and bar plots. I have completed this course at DataCamp.
